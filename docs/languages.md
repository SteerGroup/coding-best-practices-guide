# Programming Languages

While it's important to allow for flexibility in languages used, it's also
important to stick to a relatively small set of established languages within an
organization, since it encourages proficiency within the selected languages
while limiting potential for skill isolation, which can occur when too many
different languages/frameworks are used across a small user base.

By the way, if you end up doing a decent amount of coding, you'll almost
certainly need to learn multiple languages. This can sound intimidating, but
don't worry, the difficult part is learning the fundamental concepts and to
think like a programmerâ€”once you've got those down and learned one language,
other languages will be relatively easy to pick up.

This section includes descriptions of several languages recommended for
programming at Steer.

::: tip
Most programming languages are not limited to their core features, but
also allow third-party extensions, called packages, libraries, or by other
names, depending on the language.

## Python

Python is one of the most popular programming languages, and its advantages
include relatively simple syntax and versatility. Python can be used for
everything from machine learning to server-side web application development. It
is also easy to learn and has a very strong ecosystem. If you're just starting
to code, and you're not planning to focus on web development, Python is a great
first language to learn.

Python packages are available at [the Python Package Index](https://pypi.org).

## R

R is a programming language focused on statistical computing, and is mostly used
by statisticians and data analysts/scientists. R is an open-source alternative
to SAS, SPSS, and STATA. In addition to being great for working with data, R has
strong visualization capabilities, and can be used for literate programming
(where code and outputs are interspersed with text), and simple web
applications. While R is widely used, its ecosystem is much smaller than that of
Python and JavaScript, due to its greater level of specialization.

R packages are available at
[the Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org).

::: tip
Some R packages need to be compiled from source code (don't worry if that
doesn't mean anything to you). If you need to use any of these packages, you'll
want to install Rtools, which is available from the Steer Software Center.

## JavaScript

JavaScript is the most popular programming language today. It is the dominant
language used in web browsers to execute client-side code and has also become
extremely popular for server-side web application development with
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). If you're planning to do any web development,
you'll need to learn some JavaScript, along with HTML and CSS, which are
described below. JavaScript has an enormous ecosystem.

JavaScript packages are available at [npm](https://www.npmjs.com).

::: tip
Don't confuse JavaScript with Java. They are two completely different languages!

## SQL

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a domain-specific language used to access and
manage data in relational databases. At least basic SQL knowledge is essential
for anyone who plans to work extensively with data.

More about SQL in the [Databases section](data.md#databases) below.

## HTML

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the markup language used to define the
content of websites. It's quick and easy to learn the basics, and HTML knowledge
is a must for anyone developing for the web.

## CSS

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is the language that defines the styles used to
present documents written in markup languages like HTML. Learning the basics of
CSS is a core skill for anyone developing for the web.
