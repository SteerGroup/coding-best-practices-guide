# Refactoring

There's a saying that the best way to write good code is to do it once, delete
everything, and do it again. Obviously, following this advice to the letter
isn't feasible for most coding projects, but the principle is an important one.
The first time through the process, you will have gained a detailed
understanding of the intricacies of the problem you're trying to solve and
thought through the pros and cons of numerous approaches, but chances are the
code you wrote while you were learning these lessons isn't as clean as it could
be.

Refactoring is the process of revising sections of code without changing its
functionality. This can involve simple improvements like cleaning up
inconsistencies in indentation or improving variable names, more complicated
improvements like rewriting functions to be more efficient and/or cleaner, or
anything in between. Refactoring is essential to writing good code, and is well
worth the time.

Your goal shouldn't be to write perfect code the first timeâ€”that's just not how
coding works. Instead, focus initially on writing code that does just enough to
get the job done, and once you have a working version, plan to spend some
quality time going through your code and refactoring. You'll invariably find
that your final code is a huge improvement over the initial version, especially
in terms of readability. The next person to use or adapt your code (which is
often you in the future) will greatly appreciate this effort.

Refactoring is also a key component of test-driven development, which is
discussed
[earlier in this guide](quality_assurance.md#test-driven-development).
